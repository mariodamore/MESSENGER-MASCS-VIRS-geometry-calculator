# Intro

**This repository is Work In Progress**

This repository contains the code used to calculate the updated geometry for the [NASA MESSENGER](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/index.html) ([JPL](https://messenger.jhuapl.edu/) link) Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer ([MASCS](https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/instruments/mascs/)) instrument, VIRS channel.

This work was presented at [Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2023](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2023/) (LPSC), abstract number #2048.
